# Lecture 01: Coding basics

## Motivation

In this lecture we jump into the very basics of Python. This is the beginning of a long journey, which, honestly, will never end. 


## This lecture

We start with general coding principles, how to name variables, why and how to comment scripts, and we give some formatting tips. Then we cover basic variable types, assignments and operators. We end with string manipulations, showing hands-on examples how to automate the composition of SQL query strings. By the time you go through [`coding_basics.ipynb`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture01-coding-basics/coding_basics.ipynb) you will get a taste of things to come. 


## Learning outcomes

After successfully completing the learning material, students will be familiar with  

- general coding principles (for both Python and other languages)
- basic variable types of integers, gloats and booleans
- how to assign value to a variable
- how to do basic operations with these variables
- how to manipulate strings, focusing on writing some simple SQL queries, the primary tool of any data professional. 


## Datasets used
* No dataset is used in this lecture


## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **20-30 mins**. 

We tried to keep this part to the bare minimum as it is pretty straightforward. There will be many more examples on how to use variables of various types later in the course. 


## Homework

No homework for this lecture.
