# Lecture 02: Basic structures

## Motivation

Learning how to program is a long journey. The good news is that once you learn the very basics you can write your first programs. In these programs you may need some simple variables, but nothing more. As you move forward and want to write a little more complex solutions you will add more complexity to your data. Also, your solution may need other functionalities which needed to be added to your workspace when your script runs. 


## This lecture

This lecture covers `collections` of data and their usage: 

- lists
- tuples
- sets 
- dictionaries. 

In addition, we introduce `JSON`, a lightweight format for storing and transferring data. 

Finally, we show how to import, use, and write `modules`. 


## Learning outcomes

After completing this [basic_structures.ipynb](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture02-basic-structures/basic_structures.ipynb) lecture students will 

- understand the similarities and differences between the four Python collections
- be able to inspect, search and modify lists
- be able to iterate on these list
- be able to use lists in SQL script automation
- understand how tuples work
- be able to inspect dictionary items and select particular dictionary values by keys
- be able to cast lists into sets
- be able to do set operations
- be able to cast JSON-format strings into dictionaries and vice versa
- be able to import and use modules
- write and import their own modules.


## Datasets used
* No dataset is used in this lecture


## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **30-40 mins**.


## Homework

Create a dictionary. 

- Iterate through the keys and print the keys together with the values.
- Try to print a value for an unknown key (which is not included in your dictionary) in two ways:
    1. Your script throws an error when calling the unknown key.
    2. Your script prints a default values.
- Cast your dictionary keys into lists.

Create another dictionary with overlapping keys with the first one but different values. Try to merge the two. What do you see?
