# Lecture 03: Data I/O

## Motivation

Reading and writing files is a regular step in all software applications. All data containers (such as numpy arrays or Pandas data frames) have their own read and write operations, so we focus on reading text files in this lecture. 


## This lecture

This [short module](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture03-data-IO/data_IO.ipynb) shows you how to read text files from the file system, how to write and save files, and how to navigate in the file system using the `os` module. 


## Learning outcomes

After running the material's code chunks students will be able to 

- open file for reading
- reading text files line by line
- handling file encodings
- writing new files, and appending and overwriting existing files
- getting working directory information
- listing files in a directory
- creating operating system-specific file path strings
- create new directory with Python


## Datasets used
* No dataset is used in this lecture


## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **10 mins**.


## Homework

Explore the directory of your Python environment (from which you are running these codes) using the `os` module. List the content of your directory and create a new subfolder there. Write a short text in new text file saved in this directory. Read the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) how to delete files and directories, and delete this new directory and the file you have just saved there.
