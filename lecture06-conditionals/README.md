# Lecture 06: Conditional Programming

## Motivation

Deciding what to do on a case by case is widely used in decision making and also in programming. Conditional programming enables writing codes with this in mind. If a certain condition holds execute a command otherwise do something different. Conditional programming is an element of the basic programming technique, which emerges in multiple situations. Adding this technique to the programming toolbox is a must for data scientists.

## This lecture

This lecture introduces students to conditional programming with `if-else` statements. It covers the essentials control flows as `for` and `while` loop and list comprehension.


## Learning outcomes
After successfully live-coding the material (see: [`conditionals_and_control_flows.ipynb`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture06-conditionals/conditionals_and_control_flows.ipynb)), students will have knowledge on

- how a conditional statement works
- what are the crucial elements of an `if-else` statement
- what is a `for` loop
- what is a `while` loop
- wow to create a list comprehension


## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **10-20 mins**.

This is a relatively short lecture, and it can be even shorter if logical operators with vectors is neglected. Although good understanding of the anatomy of an `if-else` statement is important
